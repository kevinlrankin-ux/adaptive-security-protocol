# Adaptive Security Protocol (ASP)

**Protocol-Level Security Governance for Cost Asymmetry and Runtime Resilience**

The Adaptive Security Protocol (ASP) is a **protocol-level security governance layer**
that enforces **cost asymmetry**, **bounded defender work**, and **safe degradation under stress**.

ASP complements (not replaces) TLS, OAuth/OIDC, Zero Trust, and edge DDoS defenses by governing
**how systems behave under pressure**, even when traffic is cryptographically valid.
